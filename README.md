# CST126SRS04  
Women In Computing Linked List  


Class ID: Hippopotus

SRS ID: CST126SRS04  

Unresolved Issues:  
Errors in linkedList.cpp where values are undefiend for an unknown reason.
Data for CSWoman missions, due to issues with formatiing the data.
Data does not display in any order.
Unable to test for const correctness due to the errors in linkedList.cpp
Notes:  
I missheard on Thursday and thought the assignment was due on Friday, giving me the day off to work on it.
I did not check the calendar to dubble check. I know this does not change anything I just want you to know the situation so you do not judge me negatively.

Purpose:  

- Learn about the role women in Computer Science.  
- Learn about the singly linked list data structure.  
- Learn how to add to, delete, and reverse a singly linked list.  

Instructions:  


Name your project "WICLL".  

Choose 10 women computer scientists for this project.  

You may obtain your list from multiple sources. Here are a couple of examples to get you started:

- [10 Famous Women in Tech History](https://insights.dice.com/2016/03/14/10-famous-women-in-tech-history/)
- [Wikipedia: Women In Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing)

Create a class named CSWoman as follows:  

```
class CSWoman  
{  
private:  
    const std::string name_;  
    const unsigned birthYear_;  
    const std::string fact_;  

public:  
    CSWoman(const char* const name, const unsigned birthYear, const char* const fact);

// ... and other methods  
};  
```

Create at least 10 CSWoman objects on the heap, each representing a woman pioneer in the field of Computer Science. Provide the information described in the CSWoman ctor described above.  

Place each into a singly-linked list data structure.  

Print the list in forward order.  

Reverse the list using the provided algorithm.  

Print the list which is now in the reverse order.  

Tips:  

- All Class Policy rules apply, including but not limited to memory leaks, testing for nullptr, data corruption.  
- I am expecting a perfect submission and a clean project, even if your code fails to run.
